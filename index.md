## Research Portfolio: Entangled Narratologies  

I study narrative as an **entangled system** — networks of human and non-human actants, technologies, and traditions.  
My work develops **AI Narratology**, a critical framework for understanding how algorithmic systems already participate in storytelling, shaping coherence, causality, and cultural memory.
