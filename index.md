## Research Focus

I investigate how computational systems transform narrative traditions and cultural memory, working at the intersection of algorithmic processes and human storytelling. My research explores how AI systems encode, perpetuate, and potentially marginalize diverse cultural narrative patterns, with particular attention to ensuring algorithmic recognition of non-Western storytelling traditions.

## Current Projects

### **Perilexemes: Character Transformation in Victorian Fiction**
*A computational framework for analyzing lexical patterns of danger and transformation*  
Developing quantitative methods to trace how narrative peril functions as a mechanism for character development in Victorian novels through digital textual analysis.

### **Target as Source: Four Centuries of Odyssey Translations**
[Project Documentation](https://neophilology.github.io/English-Homer/)  
Computational analysis revealing how translation practices across 400 years reflect shifting cultural values, demonstrating how target languages increasingly shape source text interpretation.

### **Beyond-Homer: Digital Dissertation**
[Interactive Appendices](https://neophilology.github.io/Beyond-Homer/)  
Master's thesis exploring contemporary retellings of classical narratives through two interconnected studies:
- **Logosomatic Narratology**: Analyzing embodied voice and feminist retelling in Madeline Miller's *Circe*
- **Odyssean Algorithms**: Examining database narrative and computational recursion in Zachary Mason's *Lost Books*

### **Manuscript Geographies: Old English Textual Distribution**
*Interactive Visualization Suite (Coming Soon)*  
Mapping geographic and temporal distribution patterns of Old English manuscripts to reveal preservation and loss patterns in medieval textual culture.

## Research Trajectory

### AI Narratology & Posthuman Futures

My work establishes **AI narratology** as a critical field for understanding how Large Language Models function as contemporary storyteller-agents. I examine how these systems don't merely reproduce existing stories but actively construct new narrative discourses through processes exceeding simple pattern recognition.

**Core Questions:**
- How do algorithmic systems encode specific cultural narrative patterns while marginalizing others?
- What happens when Western narrative archetypes achieve computational dominance across cultural boundaries?
- How can we develop "narrative biodiversity" in AI systems to ensure diverse storytelling traditions?

### Theoretical Framework

**Contemporary Narratology**  
Examining how digital technologies alter narrative possibilities at substrate levelsâ€”from token windows to attention mechanismsâ€”creating new affordances and limitations.

**Posthuman & New Materialist Studies**  
Employing Karen Barad's diffractive methodology to
